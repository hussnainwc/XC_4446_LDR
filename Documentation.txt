This library is written for LDR's. As commonly opposed to just using analogRead
sometimes we want more complex uses of the readings.

/*

The ability to use just analogRead using the functions

ReadNoAvgLux -- if you want to read readings with no average.

ReadNoAvgFC -- same as ReadNoAvgLux but shows readings in Foot Candles.

Both the functions above take a bool param which lets the user specify
if they want to print the reading to serial.

*/

/*

The ability to read from the LDR a set number of times with delay between readings
for a set period of time.

SetSampleSize -- set number of readings to take for avg. Defaulted to 3.

SetSampleInterval -- set interval between readings for avs. Defaulted to 50 milliseconds.

ReadLux -- reads ldr and returns an average using the variables specified above.

ReadInFC -- same as ReadLux but shows reading in Foot Candles.

SetSampleSize and SetSampleInterval both take int params.

ReadLux and ReadInFC take a bool param which lets the user specify
if they want to print the reading to serial.

/*

The ability to read from the LDR a set number of times with delay between readings
for a set period of time where it discards readings which fall outside the specified
range.

SetSampleSize -- set number of readings to take for avg. Defaulted to 3.

SetSampleInterval -- set interval between readings for avs. Defaulted to 50 milliseconds.

SetRange -- set range in percent for readings. The range will be calculated in accordance
            to the reading accquired from ruinning the function begin. The range is defaulted
            to 10 percent.

SafeReadLux -- reads ldr and returns an average using the variables specified above
               only if it falls under the range.

SafeReadInFC -- same as SafeReadLux but shows readings in Foot Candles.

SetSampleSize and SetSampleInterval both take int params.

SetRange takes a float param.

SafeReadLux and SafeReadInFC take a bool param which lets the user specify
if they want to print the reading to serial.
